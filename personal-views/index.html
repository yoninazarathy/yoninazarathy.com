        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>On Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): </b> It doesn't exist yet and there isn't even a clue on how to make it. There is still a long way until "AI" will become "AGI". 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Ukraine: </b> You won't see me waiving the Ukrainian colors because I don't support nationalism. However, I think the Ukrainian people are fighting a defensive battle not just for their freedom, but also for the freedom of the rest of the world.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On eating meat: </b> Our world would be a better place if we don't.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Black Lives Matter: </b> Yes! 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Global Warming:</b> Yes. But it should be rephrased global variance (or volatility) increase.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Facebook: </b> The world would be a better place without it. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Australia: </b> An incredibly fortunate country with a pleasant and positive society. However, opening up the borders to massive (controlled) immigration is needed to keep Australia a vibrant, fair, and progressive place. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Australian obsession with sports: </b> Why not? It is cute and provides a boost to the local services economy. However it would be nice to see a paralleled obsession with knowledge and innovation. This is still (generally) lacking in Australia.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On the Australian mining industry: </b> There is too much stuff in the ground and this reduces the motivation to truly innovate and lead the world in the fight against global warming. In fact, Australia is doing horribly on this front. Shame.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On the Australian primary and secondary education system: </b> It is in a sad state of affairs and no one wishes to call it out. A key problem is the private-public system, and another major problem is the fact that school teachers are often not properly educated in their domain of teaching. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Islamic extremists: </b> See my view about Facebook above. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On gender inequality in the workplace: </b> We must take active steps to get rid of gender inequality.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On racial inequality: </b> Societies as a whole need to remove racial inequality via economic and social reforms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On the Chinese Communist Party: </b> See my view about Facebook above.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On freedom of speech in China - and Hong Kong: </b> What freedom of speech?
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On the American second amendment: </b> Legalized stupidity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On the Israeli occupation of the West Bank:</b> A big moral mistake made by the Israelis that is inflicting too much unpleasantness on the Palestinians and will eventually cost Israel a big deal.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On the ability of Palestinians to create a productive positive state:</b> There is no such ability yet. Unfortunately, they are far from it and extremists are in control. See my view on Islamic extremists above.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On World War III:</b> It is unfortunately bound to happen at some point. Let's hope this isn't anytime soon. In any case, we must each make sure to create good things, make meaningful connections and show love, and enjoy every step of the way till it happens.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On religion in general:</b> Even though I think about it much, I still haven't worked out where I stand on religion. I guess it goes to show it is a complicated issue. Or maybe I just don't have a clue myself. I am certainly turned off by people who make their choices simply based on some dictation of their religion's rules. But I also appreciate the important role that religion carries out in governance. So I don't know. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On University higher management in most Australian universities: </b> I am not impressed one bit by this mix of quasi-professor-politician-semi-corporate gang of regulators. As a rule of thumb in Australian universities, as a  individual's salaries increases beyond $250K, you are bound to see that the individual exhibits a lack of appreciation for academic quality and good university practices. (There are always exceptions to this rule).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On academics that refrain from sharing their views : </b> Not ok. It is your job to share your views while respecting the views of others.
            </li>
