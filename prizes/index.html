        <h1 class="my-3">Prize Draws for the Safe Blues 2021 Experiment</h1>

        <h2 style="color:red">(Subject to ethics approval)</h2>


    <h2 class="my-3">The rules</h2>
    <p> 
        As you participate in the Safe Blues experiment you collect hours which increase your chances of winning prizes. The more hours you collect the higher your chances. Here is how it works:
        <ul>
            <li>When you run the Safe Blues app on or close to the University of Auckland City Campus (within the geo-fenced area), you collect <b>campus hours</b>. Every hour you run the app on campus is another hour collected.</li>
            <li> A maximum of 10 campus hours&#42 per day can be collected.</li>
            <li> Note that during the days of June 10 to July 18 (inter-semester break), the collection of campus hours is suspended.</li>
            <li> You can track your collected campus hours and see how many hours you have collected relative to the distribution of hours collected by other participants. This can give you an indication of your chances of winning prizes. </li>
            <li> There are three <b>prize draws during 2021</b>, scheduled on the following dates: <b>June 10</b>, <b>Sep 16</b>, <b>and Nov 4</b>. </li>
            <li> In each prize draw, prizes are drawn as follows: </li>
            <ul>
                <li> The <b>eligible hours</b> you have in each prize draw is your total number of campus hours since joining or since the last prize draw, capped at 200 hours&#42. That is, if you collected more than 200 campus hours, your eligible hours for the draw will remain at 200. </li>
                <li> Your chance of winning a prize is your eligible hours divided by the total number of eligible hours of all participants.</li>
                <li> There are 9 prizes in each draw. A single top prize (<b>iPad Pro</b>), 3 second tier prizes (<b>Android mobile phones</b>), and 5 third tier prizes (<b>FitBit tracker</b>).</li>
                <li> You may win at most one prize in a draw and this works as follows. First everyone competes for the top prize and the winner is removed from the pool. Then all remaining participants compete for the second tier prizes, each time removing the winner. Similarly for the third tier. </li>
                <li> A participant is eligible to win at most a single prize from each tier over the course of the experiment. For instance, a winner of the top prize in the first draw will be excluded from the draws for the top prize in the second and third draws. </li>
            </ul>
            <li> All participants will be a mailed a full report from the prize draw and the winners may collect their prizes at a given location in The University of Auckland.</li>
            <li> Winners will be asked if they wish to have their picture and short bio posted on the this page. This is optional.</li>
        </ul>
        <small>&#42 The hour caps are set for the first prize draw, yet we reserve the right to change these for the second and third prize draw to maximize equity.</small>
