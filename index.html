            These are additional notable themes of my work:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Safe Blues - A method for control and estimation in epidemics</b> - This is a COVID-19 inspired project dealing with collection of additional information via virtual safe virus spread and using the information to make better predictions and control decisions. I lead this project.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reinforcement Learning of Restless Bandits</b> - The problem of dynamically allocating resources out of a limited pool to an evolving project is a central problem in machine learning and operations research. This research theme focuses on one useful abstraction in this domain, called restless bandits.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The Mathematical Engineering of Deep Learning</b> - Deep learning is in many ways "mathematical engineering". It is a collection of methods that work well in practice to create an "Artificial Intelligence" illusion.
                <a href="/math-eng-deep-learning">[More...]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Structured Markov Chains and Linear Control Theory</b> - The interface of Matrix Analytic Models (MAM) and linear control theory is interesting and non-trivial. The underlying mathematics for linear systems and phase type distributions is very similar and there is room to make connections between the two fields.
                <a href="/smc-lct">[More...]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The BRAVO Effect in queues</b> - BRAVO stands for "Balancing Reduces Asymptotic Variance of Outputs". It is a queueing models phenomenon that I discovered. Understanding it requires understanding how queueing models operate at threshold regimes.
                <a href="/bravo">[More...]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Queueing Network scheduling and control</b> - This theme deals with the analysis and control for scheduling decisions of complex queueing networks where items traverse different stations over time and resource allocation decisions are to be made online
                <a href="/queueing-networks">[More...]</a>
            </li>
            <li>

                <a href="/queue-parameter-estimation">[More...]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Truncated distribution</b> - This theme deals with univariate and multivariate distributions that are truncated to a particular region. Moment matching and truncation correction techniques are developed and implemented
                <a href="/truncated-distributions">[More...]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>One on Epsilon and Mathematics Eduction</b> - One on Epsilon is a mathematics eduction project that pulls resources from the web to aid school teachers, parents, and students better understand the "why" beyond just the "how" of mathematics. Additional mathematics eduction projects around this theme involve educating school teachers about the mathematics of "Artificial Intelligence".

        <h2 class="my-3">Views</h2>
        <p>
            An academic webpage is not complete without a few personal items and some personal views. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I do quite a bit of driving these years, mostly involving my three kids. So during this time, I get a chance to reflect and refine my views. Here are some views:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>On the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): </b> It doesn't exist yet and there isn't even a clue on how to make it. There is still a long way until "AI" will become "AGI". 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On eating meat: </b> Our world would be a better place if we don't.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Black Lives Matter: </b> Yes! 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Facebook: </b> The world would be a better place without it. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Australia: </b> An incredibly fortunate country with a pleasant and positive society. However, opening up the borders to massive (controlled) immigration is needed to keep Australia a vibrant, fair, and progressive place. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Australian obsession with sports: </b> Why not? It is cute and provides a boost to the local services economy. However it would be nice to see a paralleled obsession with knowledge and innovation. This is still (generally) lacking in Australia.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On the Australian mining industry: </b> There is too much stuff in the ground and this reduces the motivation to truly innovate and lead the world in the fight against global warming. In fact, Australia is doing horribly on this front. Shame.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On the Australian primary and secondary education system: </b> It is in a sad state of affairs and no one wishes to call it out. A key problem is the private-public system, and another major problem is the fact that school teachers are often not properly educated in their domain of teaching. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Islamic extremists: </b> See my view about Facebook above. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On gender inequality in the workplace: </b> We must take active steps to get rid of gender inequality.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On racial inequality: </b> Societies as a whole need to remove racial inequality via economic and social reforms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On the Chinese Communist Party: </b> See my view about Facebook above.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On freedom of speech in China - and Hong Kong: </b> What freedom of speech?
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On the American second amendment: </b> Legalized stupidity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On the Israeli occupation of the West Bank:</b> A big moral mistake made by the Israelis that is inflicting too much unpleasantness on the Palestinians and will eventually cost Israel a big deal.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On the ability of Palestinians to create a productive positive state:</b> There is no such ability yet. Unfortunately, they are far from it and extremists are in control. See my view on Islamic extremists above.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On World War III:</b> It is unfortunately bound to happen. Better do the best we can prior, and make sure to enjoy the way too.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On religion in general:</b> Even though I think about it much, I still haven't worked out where I stand on religion. I guess it goes to show it is a complicated issue. Or maybe I just don't have a clue myself. I am certainly turned off by people who make their choices simply based on some dictation of their religion's rules. But I also appreciate the important role that religion carries out in governance. So I don't know. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On University higher management in most Australian Universities: </b> I am not impressed one bit by this mix of quasi-professor-politician-semi-corporate gang of regulators. As a rule of thumb in Australia, as an University individual's salaries increases beyond $250K, you are bound to see that the individual exhibits a lack of appreciation for academic quality and good university practices.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On academics that refrain from sharing their views : </b> Shame on you! It is your job to share your views while respecting the views of others.
            </li>
