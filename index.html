            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reinforcement Learning of Restless Bandits</b> - The problem of dynamically allocating resources out of a limited pool to an evolving project is a central problem in machine learning and operations research. This research theme focuses on one useful abstraction in this domain, called restless bandits.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The Mathematical Engineering of Deep Learning</b> - Deep learning is in many ways "mathematical engineering". It is a collection of methods that work well in practice to create an "Artificial Intelligence" illusion.

            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Structured Markov Chains and Linear Control Theory</b> - The interface of Matrix Analytic Models (MAM) and linear control theory is interesting and non-trivial. The underlying mathematics for linear systems and phase type distributions is very similar and there is room to make connections between the two fields.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The BRAVO Effect in queues</b> - BRAVO stands for "Balancing Reduces Asymptotic Variance of Outputs". It is a queueing models phenomenon that I discovered. Understanding it requires understanding how queueing models operate at threshold regimes.

            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>One on Epsilon and Mathematics Education</b> - One on Epsilon is a mathematics education project that pulls resources from the web to aid school teachers, parents, and students better understand the "why" beyond just the "how" of mathematics. Additional mathematics education projects around this theme involve educating school teachers about the mathematics of "Artificial Intelligence".

            An academic webpage is not complete without a few personal items and some personal views.
        </p>
        <p>
            I do quite a bit of (car) driving these years, mostly involving my <a href="/img/kids.jpg"> kids</a>, my wife <a href ="/img/miriamYoniDash.jpg">Miriam</a> and our dog Dash. So during this time, I get a chance to reflect and refine my views. There are a few <a href="/opinion-blog-posts-and-videos/">opinion blog posts</a> that I have written. Here are some more views:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>On Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): </b> It doesn't exist yet. A few years ago I thought that there isn't even a clue on how to make it. But since the rise of LLMs I think that sheer scale might do the job. Let's see...
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Israel, Gaza, and all that:</b> This is a big subject where I believe that I am quite informed and I have many subtle views. In a nutshell I think: (1) Israel is slowly loosing its moral ground and has probably past the point of no return. It is becoming and aggressive Apartheid state. (2) Palestinian culture is violent at its core and is based on victim mentality and not on doing constructive stuff. It almost looses its definition if Israel vanishes. Worse of all, Palestinians don't seem to be looking for constructive solutions for building lives but rather converge on murderous organizations like Hamas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Ukraine: </b> You won't see me waiving the Ukrainian colors because I don't support nationalism. However, I think the Ukrainian people are fighting a defensive battle not just for their freedom, but also for the freedom of the rest of the world.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On eating meat: </b> Our world would be a better place if we don't.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On Global Warming:</b> Yes. But it should be rephrased global variance (or volatility increase).
