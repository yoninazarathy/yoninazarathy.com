            These are additional notable themes of my work:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Safe Blues - A method for control and estimation in epidemics</b> - This is a COVID-19 inspired project dealing with collection of additional information via virtual safe virus spread and using the information to make better predictions and control decisions. I lead this project.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reinforcement Learning of Restless Bandits</b> - The problem of dynamically allocating resources out of a limited pool to an evolving project is a central problem in machine learning and operations research. This research theme focuses on one useful abstraction in this domain, called restless bandits.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The Mathematical Engineering of Deep Learning</b> - Deep learning is in many ways "mathematical engineering". It is a collection of methods that work well in practice to create an "Artificial Intelligence" illusion.
                <a href="/math-eng-deep-learning">[More...]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Structured Markov Chains and Linear Control Theory</b> - The interface of Matrix Analytic Models (MAM) and linear control theory is interesting and non-trivial. The underlying mathematics for linear systems and phase type distributions is very similar and there is room to make connections between the two fields.
                <a href="/smc-lct">[More...]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The BRAVO Effect in queues</b> - BRAVO stands for "Balancing Reduces Asymptotic Variance of Outputs". It is a queueing models phenomenon that I discovered. Understanding it requires understanding how queueing models operate at threshold regimes.
                <a href="/bravo">[More...]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Queueing Network scheduling and control</b> - This theme deals with the analysis and control for scheduling decisions of complex queueing networks where items traverse different stations over time and resource allocation decisions are to be made online
                <a href="/queueing-networks">[More...]</a>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Truncated distribution</b> - This theme deals with univariate and multivariate distributions that are truncated to a particular region. Moment matching and truncation correction techniques are developed and implemented

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>One on Epsilon and Mathematics Eduction</b> - One on Epsilon is a mathematics eduction project that pulls resources from the web to aid school teachers, parents, and students better understand the "why" beyond just the "how" of mathematics. Additional mathematics eduction projects around this theme involve educating school teachers about the mathematics of "Artificial Intelligence".

            An academic webpage is not complete without a few personal items and some personal views.

        <p>
            I do quite a bit of (car) driving these years, mostly involving my <a href="/img/kids.jpg"> kids</a>, my partner <a href ="/img/miriamYoniDash.jpg">Miriam</a> and our dog Dash. So during this time, I get a chance to reflect and refine my views. There are a few <a href="/opinion-blog-posts">opinion blog posts</a> that I have written. Here are some more views:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>On Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): </b> It doesn't exist yet and there isn't even a clue on how to make it. There is still a long way until "AI" will become "AGI". 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>On eating meat: </b> Our world would be a better place if we don't.
